# crDroidPlusPlus_kernel
_Because we just all really missed the circa 2019 flavor of having a million useless TCP congestion algorithms to choose from._

### Seriously though:
I'm not going to include KernelSU commits in the official crDroid release kernel, since it's a potentially enormous security risk and my capacity for making emergency security-related releases is very limited.

That said, you're already running a custom ROM on a device with unlocked bootloader maintained by a nitwit that's arguably three raccoons in a trenchcoat; so how much worse could a little kernelspace root driver or overclocked GPU voltage/frequency table possibly be? üòÅ
